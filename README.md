#  Strongly Connected Components
 
    In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a graph is said to be strongly connected 
    if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. The strongly connected components of an 
    arbitrary directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are theselves strongly connected.

## Kosaraju's Algorithm

   In computer science, Kosaraju's algorithm, also known as the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm, is a linear
   time algorith to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
