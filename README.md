#  Strongly Connected Components
 
    In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable
    from every other vertex. The strongly connected components of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into subgraphs
    that are theselves strongly connected.
